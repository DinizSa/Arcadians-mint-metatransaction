# `mint-as-metatransaction` based on `moralis-biconomy-metatransactions`

This Project is a fork of [Ethereum Boilerplate](https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-boilerplate) and demostrates how you can enable gasless transaction/metatransactions using Moralis and Biconomy. This project of course work on any EVM-compatible blockchain such as Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain and other such chains.

# üöÄ Quick Start

üìÑ Clone or fork `moralis-biconomy-metatransactions`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DinizSa/Arcadians-mint-with-metatransaction
```
üíø Install all dependencies:
```sh
cd moralis-biconomy-metatransactions
yarn install 
```
‚úè Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the main folder and provide your `appId` and `serverUrl` from Moralis ([How to start Moralis Server](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/getting-started/create-a-moralis-server)), plus some other Biconomy API Keys and UI related variables:
```jsx
// Web3
REACT_APP_MORALIS_APPLICATION_ID=xxx
REACT_APP_MORALIS_SERVER_URL=xxx
REACT_APP_MORALIS_SPEEDY_NODES_KEY=xxx
REACT_APP_BICONOMY_API_KEY_KOVAN=xxx
REACT_APP_BICONOMY_API_KEY_BSC_TESTNET=xxx
REACT_APP_BICONOMY_API_KEY_MUMBAI=xxx
REACT_APP_BICONOMY_API_KEY_FUJI=xxx
// UI
REACT_APP_COLLECTION_NAME=xxx
REACT_APP_COLLECTION_LOGO=xxx
REACT_APP_COLLECTION_LOGO_REDIRECT=xxx
```

‚úè Create a `.secret` document on the root of the folder, and paste the mnemonic of the account that you want o use as deployer of the contracts (Make sure it has native currency in the network that you will deploy.

‚úè Deploy your contracts
cd ./Truffle
yarn compile
yarn migrate --network {network_name}
yarn verify {deployed_contract_address} {constructor_paramneter_01} --network {network_name}

Note: In order the frontend to know with which contract he should communicate, paste the newly contract address generated in the migrate step in the respective `chainId` in the file `list/yourCollectible.json`. 
For example, for the mumbai network, the chainId is 80001, so it corresponds to the hexadecimal 0x13881. Then in the `yourCollectible.json`, the key `0x13881` will have the value as the address of the deployed contract.

# Metatransaction components
There are four components that allow the metatransaction flow
‚úè Frontend application
Send signed metatransaction to the relay

‚úè Biconomy Relay
You need to setup a relay so he can receive the metatransaction, and call the trusted forwarder contract, paying for the gas of the transaction. In this project we use the (biconomy relay)[https://dashboard.biconomy.io/dapps]. To see how to setup this relay, please check the (tutorial video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r04x1YqnYLk&list=LL&index=6]. This relay needs to have funds so he can pay for the transaction.

‚úè Trusted Forwarder contract
You don't need to deploy this contract, since biconomy deployed the TrustedForwarder contract in several networks, which you can use. See `Truffle/list/biconomyForwarder.json` to see the address of this contract in each network.

‚úè Recipient contract
This is the final contract that you want to change state with the metatransaction. There are come changes that you need to do in your contract.
  - Make your contract extend from "@opengsn/contracts/src/BaseRelayRecipient.sol"
  - Register via argument in the constructor of your contract the address of `biconomyForwarder.json`, for the desired network.
  - Through all the contract, replace `msg.sender()` with `_msgSender()`, so your contract has the ability to properly read the sender address in case of metatransactions.

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run your App:
```sh
yarn start
```
